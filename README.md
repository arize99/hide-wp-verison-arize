** FAQ **

~ Why do I need to hide my WordPress Version?

== When hackers get the version of your WordPress site, it will be easier for them to hack into it. So leave less information hanging around for them.

~ Why should I use this plugin when I can just put the code into my "functions.php" file? =

You can do that - but when you update or change your theme, it will be removed (along with any other modifications done to the functions.php file).

~ So this plugin will always hide my WordPress version details no matter how many times I change my theme or update it?

== Yes. provided the plugin is active, your details are hidden.
